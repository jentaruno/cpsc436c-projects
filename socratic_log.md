# Socratic Log

Context: Using k-anonymity for the completion time averages.  
Prompts below given to ChatGPT, after I've given it context on my project details. Auxiliary details from ChatGPT's responses are omitted for brevity.

### Prompts that led to a design alternative

Prompt:
> "Consider guardrails to protect users' privacy, like k-anonymity, jitter/aggregation, opt-ins, disclosure. Explain why it's important and what trade-offs result."

Response
> k-Anonymity  
What it is: Don’t release any aggregate (e.g., average completion times) unless at least k users share that same attribute (say k=10).  
Why it matters: Prevents unique fingerprints in your dataset  
Trade-off:  
✅ Safer aggregates.  
❌ Rare games with few players may not be covered → reduces coverage/utility.

### Red-team prompt
Prompt:
> Should we even care about re-identification if it's a game playtime app? What's so dangerous about it?

Response
> That’s a fair question — on the surface, game playtime data feels harmless. But there are some risks you should consider:<br/>  
**Why re-identification might matter**  
1\. Quasi-identifiers leak context: Even without IPs/UA/location, something like a UUID tied to completion time + game title can start to look unique, especially for niche/indie games with only a few completions.  
2\. Linkability across services: If someone posts their play history on a forum, or you share data with partners, it could be linked back to them.  
3\. Behavioral inference: Long playtimes, late-night completions, or rapid finishes could reveal personal circumstances (unemployment, insomnia, or disability).  
4\. Legal/compliance angle: Even if you think it’s low risk, regulators often require you to show that you assessed and mitigated re-identification risk.<br/>  
**What makes it less dangerous here**  
1\. No sensitive categories (not health, finance, or biometrics).  
2\. Limited fields, with no IPs, UAs, or direct identifiers.  
3\. Purpose is narrow (capacity planning / aggregate reporting, not profiling individuals).<br/>  
**Balanced stance**  
1\. You don’t need bank-level privacy here, but you should show you’ve thought about k-anonymity, aggregation, and retention.  
2\. A small k (say, k=5 or k=10) plus truncation (e.g., round completion times to nearest hour) is usually enough to remove most re-ident risks in entertainment datasets.  
3\. Keep the “minimization & safeguards” story consistent — it makes your project look responsible without overengineering.

### Inflection point
I continued to disagree:
> HowLongToBeat publishes each user's playtime that was submitted in the website. Shouldn't that mean it's fine to link data to its user?

Response:
> That’s an important distinction 👇<br/>  
On HowLongToBeat (HLTB), people submit their playtimes knowingly, with usernames, and those are published openly. The context is clear: “I’m putting my data into a public site, attached to my account.” Linking there is expected because the service is built around public contributions.<br/>  
On your project, the premise is more “private tracking” + “personalized prediction". Users may assume their submissions are for their own use, not to be publicized or shared. If you publish or share data without strong anonymization, you risk breaking that expectation — even if technically it’s “just game times.”

### Outcome
I ended up using k-anonymity, with k≥10. If we have less than that number of playtime entries, there would be bucketing, e.g. return a result of “10–20 hours” instead of “12 hours.”

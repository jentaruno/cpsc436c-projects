## Top 3 insights

1. Insight: 
   - Evidence: (figure/table ref, statistic, link to code cell)
   - Why it matters: (stakeholders, design/ethics impact)
   - Limits: (assumptions, missing data, alternative explanations)
   - Next question:

3. **k-anonymity on aggregations to protect** 
   - Evidence: See [Socratic Log](socratic_log.md) and [PIA](pia.md)
   - Why it matters: This service is principally a personalized prediction API, so users likely don't expect to see their completion times on a public leaderboard. Moreover, even if I think itâ€™s low risk, regulators often require showing that I assessed and mitigated re-identification risk
   - Limits: Assumption; I'm taking ChatGPT's word for the legal compliance requirement here, and just erring on the side of caution.
   - Next question: Should we differentiate k by who is accessing it? (e.g. engineers vs public)
